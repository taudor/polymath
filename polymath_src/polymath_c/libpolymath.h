 * Transforms an array of uint8_t numbers into a Poly_Array.
 *
 * The array pointed to by uint8_t* src with length uint64_t src_len
 * is interpreted as a array containing only 0 and 1 and transformed
 * into a Poly_Array. That means that each of the original "bits"
 * now takes exactly one bit space.
 * The Poly_Array is interpreted as a univariate polynomial of
 * length (src_len // (sizeof(uint64_t) * 8) + 1). The degree of the polynomial
 * is the position of the first non-zero entry in the array minus one.
 * Only the rightmost bit of each uint8_t number is used as coefficient.
 *
 * Parameters
 * src      -   pointer to the uint8_t array to transform to a Poly_Array
 * src_len  -   number of elements of src
 *
 * Return value
 * Upon successful transformation uint64_to_Poly_Array returns a
 * a Poly_Array object of the transformed array.
 * If the transformation is not successful a NULL pointer is returned.

 * Computes the remainder of tow polynomials with 0 padding

 * A        -   Pointer to the data of the dividend polynomial
 * n        -   Number of elements / coefficients of the dividend
 * B        -   Pointer to the data of the divisor polynomial. If the

 * m        -   Number of elements / coefficients of the divisor
 * ret_ptr  -   Address of the pointer to the data of the remainder after
 *              successful completion of the function. The data is filled
 *              with zeros from top. This is useful if the results must
 *              have all the same length.
 * ret_len  -   Number of elements / coefficients of the remainder.

 * Multiplies two polynomials.

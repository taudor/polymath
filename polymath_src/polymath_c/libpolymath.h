 * Transforms an array of uint64_t numbers into a Poly_Array.
 *
 * The array pointed to by uint64_t* src with length uint64_t src_len

 * into a Poly_Array. That means that each of the original "bits"
 * now takes exactly one bit space.
 * The Poly_Array is interpreted as a univariate polynomial of
 * length (src_len // (sizeof(uint64_t) * 8) + 1). The degree of the polynomial
 * is the position of the first non-zero entry in the array minus one.
 * Only the rightmost bit of each uint64_t number is used as coefficient.
 *
 * Parameters
 * src      -   pointer to the uint64_t array to transform to a Poly_Array
 * src_len  -   number of elements of src
 *
 * Return value
 * Upon successful transformation uint64_to_Poly_Array returns a
 * a Poly_Array object of the transformed array.
 * If the transformation is not successful a NULL pointer is returned.
